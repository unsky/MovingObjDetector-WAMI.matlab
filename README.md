# Moving Object detection in Wide-Area Motion Imagery (matlab version)
Moving object detection (vehicles) for WAMI images

Algorithm was trained using WPAFB dataset: https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=wpafb2009

Decompress WPAFB dataset under "WPAFB-images\ntf\"

Run "WPAFB-images\nitf2png.m" to convert ntf images to png images.

Run "Medi_BgSub_CNN_full_img_test.m" to test one frame.

Run "Medi_BgSub_CNN_full_img_batch.m" to process all frames.
